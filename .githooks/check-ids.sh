# The ID-scheme gate (standing rule 4, policy set 2026-09-09).
#
# The large rename was cancelled after measuring what it would cost: an ID
# means different things in different projects, and a document quotes a
# sibling project's IDs beside its own, so an ID-keyed rewrite silently
# repoints references. Kenny's replacement is narrower and self-dosing:
# new items are born in the new shape, and an old one is translated only
# when it surfaces by itself. This gate holds up the two halves of that
# which a machine can hold.
#
#   1. A NEW identifier may not be born in the old shape. Only ADDED
#      lines are read, so existing tables stay exactly as they are.
#   2. A translation is whole or it is refused. Once a project's ID map
#      records old -> new, the old name may not survive anywhere in the
#      tracked files; half a rename is worse than none, because the two
#      documents then disagree and neither says which is real.
#
# Plain bash and git. No Claude, no network, no dev-procedure checkout —
# same independence as the rest of the git-native layer.

# ---- 1. no new identifier in the old shape -------------------------------
# An ID is "born" on a line that defines one: a table row or a heading that
# starts with it. A mere mention is not a birth, so prose keeps working.
# A file whose job is to record old names is excluded from this check —
# this convention's own ID_TRANSLATIONS.md and a project's existing
# ID_MAP.md alike. The first drill blocked a perfectly good map for
# containing exactly what it exists to contain, and binary-puzzle-toolkit's
# real one then blocked every commit in that repository.

#
#   * The name is this convention's own. The first version read
#     docs/ID_MAP.md, a name binary-puzzle-toolkit already used for
#     something else — a record of which pre-merge commits carry which
#     old numbers — and reading it as "these may no longer appear" locked
#     that repository out of committing entirely.
#   * The file must opt in with an exact header line, so a file that
#     merely shares the name never activates the gate by accident.
