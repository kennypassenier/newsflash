# HOOK_VERSION=2
# Dev-procedure commit gate (option B): a PreToolUse hook on the Bash
# tool. Blocks `git commit` unless (1) the project's gates pass and
# (2) the commit message carries feature/milestone IDs in brackets.
#
# Contract: Claude Code pipes the tool call as JSON on stdin. Exit 0
# allows the command; exit 2 blocks it and feeds stderr back to Claude.
# Parse failures fail OPEN (exit 0) so a broken hook never bricks work.
#
# PROC-H1 (found on kp-themes 2026-09-04, fixed at its retrospective).
# Three faults lived in the old one-line test `case "$cmd" in
# *"git commit"*)`:
#
#   1. It matched the WORDS anywhere in the command, so any command that
#      merely quoted an example commit message was blocked. Writing a
#      document that quotes one is not committing. Heredoc bodies and
#      quoted strings are now masked before anything is matched, and the
#      match has to sit at a command position.
#   2. A PreToolUse hook runs BEFORE the command, so a compound command
#      that formats and then commits is always judged on the unformatted
#      tree and can never pass, however often it is retried.
#   3. Blocking a compound command blocks all of it, including setup that
#      had not run yet — a `git checkout -b` that never happened, after
#      which the retry lands the work on whatever branch was already
#      there. An L2 commit landed on `main` exactly this way.
#
# (2) and (3) cannot be fixed by gating harder, only by refusing early
# and saying so, which is what the `compound` verdict below does.
